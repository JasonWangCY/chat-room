## Chat Room

### *In progress!*

This is a simple Chat Room application written in C# 
that allows multiple clients to connect to a single
server and communicate with each other in real-time.

The purpose of this project is to gain more understanding
of networking, particularly the TCL/IP layers and socket
communications. Handling multithreading and concurrency
properly is another central focus, and ensuring thread
safety.

This program, at its current state, references heavily
from [this great online Java tutorial](https://www.codejava.net/java-se/networking/how-to-create-a-chat-console-application-in-java-using-socket), 
except that I have rewritten everything from scratch in C#.
